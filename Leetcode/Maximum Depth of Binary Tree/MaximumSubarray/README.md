# 53.Maximum Subarray(Leetcode)

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

#Example 1:
>`Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`<br>
`Output: 6`<br>
`Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.`

#Constraints:

`1 <= nums.length <= 105`<br>
`-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
